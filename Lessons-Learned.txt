1. Making a unified python program was more difficult that I thought to work local and to openai.
   the local ollama would not take the new call.
   never really did have a good example on how to pull in a user's api key

2. Adding JavaScript with NodeJS was an after thought 

3. making helper bat files was an after thought

4. making install helper bat files was an after thought.
   Ansible would add another layer of complexity .. so would powershell or wsl

5. If I used powershell for the scripts, we would have to change the registery 
   to be able to run powershell scripts from the commandline 

6. I started saving the stories .. I liked one so much I made a word document "Under a silver moon.docx" 

7. Linux or WSL environment maybe preferred .. Win11 is more accessable to more people.

8.  the list of models for openai keep changing
    prompt: with the python openai client what are some models I can sue?
